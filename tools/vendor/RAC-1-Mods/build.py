"""Box Breaker and Charge Boots for Ratchet & Clank 1 HD (NPEA00385).

Box Breaker
-----------
The hyper-strike is hero state 0x14. When it lands, hero_update (0xaaec0) sweeps a 0.4 unit
sphere at 0xb01f4 and damages whatever is inside. That call is redirected into a cave that
runs the original sweep and then a crate-only sweep with a large radius, built from the same
calls the game itself uses for its crate-only sweeps.
As in RC2, the strike shakes the screen when the wrench comes down (RC2 0x83d640): RC2's third
camera shake channel, a roll about the view axis that RC1's camera does not have, is ported and
started with RC2's values. Not in RC2: the bolts of crates that break within 35 frames of the
sweep fly to Ratchet at once, through the bolt spawner's own flag for that.

Charge Boots
------------
A port of RC2's charge state (hero state 0x7b, handler 0x83f5e8 in RC2.ppu.elf) built from
the RC1 counterparts of the functions it calls:
  * press R1 twice within 30 frames, from a ground state, to start; it keeps going while
    R1 is held and for at least 60 frames
  * 30 units/s for the first 60 frames, then 11.5 units/s; 100 units/s^2 up, 15 down
  * steering turns Ratchet relative to his own heading from smoothed stick left/right,
    1.22 rad/s at full stick, a tenth of that during the burst; no stick needed to dash
  * crates ahead are broken, and both feet leave RC2's two-layer trail
  * Ratchet hovers 0.17 above the ground on RC2's spring; there is no gravity and no fall,
    so off a ledge the spring lowers him at 7.5 units/s while the charge goes on
  * RC2's own transitions for the charge state and nothing else: it ends through the skid
    state (R1 released, a magnetic surface, an override animation), and running into a wall
    throws Ratchet back in the bump state, which RC1 has too (0x7a). No jump, no weapons or
    gadgets, no wrench
  * surfaces (ice, lava, water) act on the hovering Ratchet as they do in RC2
RC1 has no charge state, so the port runs in place of hero_update while a charge is active
and Ratchet is in the idle or walk state, and those two states' own transitions and the
weapon/gadget chooser are skipped meanwhile. A per-frame hook in front of hero_main runs the
trigger and RC2's transitions, and hides R1 from the game so Ratchet does not crouch.
The charge animation is RC2's own (Ratchet animation 139), embedded in the ELF, and so are
RC2's charge loop and end sounds (a cut-down copy of one RC2 level sound bank).
The Charge Boots are an entry of their own under Foot Items on the pause menu's Gadgets page,
owned from the start and put on by default. The confirm button there takes them off and puts
them on again, as it does with the Magneboots and Grindboots. While they are on, Ratchet wears
RC2's Charge Boots model (class 0xe70 with its texture, embedded) through RC1's foot slot
whenever the game does not want other boots there; taken off, there is no charge and no boost
at the bolt crank. The Grindboots keep their own model.
RC2's camera tuning for the charge is written to RC1's camera config struct.

Strafing
--------
A port of RC2's strafing. RC2 keeps a timer at hero +0x1454 that is 1 while L2 or R2 is held
(hero_main 0x816aa0) and tests it in its hero code; RC1's hero code is the older version of the
same functions, so each of those branches is inserted at the matching RC1 instruction:
  * walking (RC2 0x83ee6c, RC1 0xb1630): Ratchet turns to the camera's yaw and moves along the
    stick's heading (RC2 0x82c238), with RC2's damping when left and right are reversed
  * standing: holding the button turns him to the camera (idle -> walk, RC2 0x84bd80), and the
    walk state lasts until he is aligned (RC2 0x84d770); letting the stick go while strafing
    takes him straight to idle at 1.5 units/s at most (RC2 0x84d7f0) instead of RC1's skid
  * moving sideways twists the body through the two joint controllers RC2 uses for it
    (RC2 0x830a5c); moving backwards plays RC2's backwards walk (RC2 0x836018). That is
    Ratchet animation 0x14 in RC2; RC1 has its skid there, so RC2's is embedded
  * jump with the stick held sideways or back: RC1's own flip state 0xb, chosen and aimed by the
    strafe direction as in RC2 (0x835e64, 0x833698, 0x83388c, 0x848810, 0x82f91c)
  * in the air he keeps facing the camera and moves along the stick's heading (RC2 0x83007c,
    0x8429e4)
In RC1, L2 does what L1 does (first-person view) and R2 what R1 does (crouch). While Ratchet is
on foot (states up to 0x15) the two buttons are taken out of the pad's button words every frame,
so they only strafe; in other states (vehicles, the hover with its own L2/R2 strafe) they are
left alone. Strafing is off while RC1's magnetic-surface flag (hero +0x20b3) is set.
Ratchet speeds up and slows down on the ground as in RC2: 18 and 20 units/s^2 instead of RC1's
7.5 and 8.5, with RC2's three rules for speed while he turns in the walk state
(--rc1-acceleration keeps RC1's).
Not ported: RC2's reads of the timer in 0x82e4b0 (speed bookkeeping), 0x817c68 (a counter of
strafing frames), 0x812e28 (resets hero +0x1e8) and 0x819898 (first-person mode sets the timer).

Bolt crank boost (not in RC2)
-----------------------------
Double-tapping and holding R1 while Ratchet turns a bolt crank (hero state 0x3b, driven by the
crank's own update 0x32adf8) raises the crank's speed cap from 3.7 to 30 units/s (the charge's burst speed), with the
charge animation, sound and foot trails. Position and facing follow the circle at once there.

Clank's thruster dash (not in the games)
----------------------------------------
While the player is Clank (hero +0x20a4 = 1; his idle and walk states are 0x43 and 0x44), R1
held, the stick pushed and X pressed on the ground start a dash: he turns to the stick's
heading at once and makes Ratchet's Thruster-Pack long jump (state 0x10) with Ratchet's own
numbers: 11.5 units/s reached at 44 units/s^2, launched after 5 frames to a height of 0.4
under a gravity of 8.5 units/s^2 (0.6 s in the air, about 7 units), breaking the crates
ahead of him as that jump does. The camera is given the state type of a jump meanwhile, and
a wall that stops him, or the camera in his way, throws him back as the game's bump state
(0x7a) throws Ratchet, done here with Clank's hit animation. It ends when he
touches the ground, at his run speed. Meanwhile he is pitched forward by 90 degrees (hero
euler y, hero +0x94, turned in over 6 frames and back out afterwards), holds his fall
animation, and carries the Thruster-Pack's device (class 0x260, loaded in every level) with
its wings out: a moby of its own that takes his moby's position and matrix every frame.
Like the charge it runs in place of hero_update with the state left
as it is, and that state's transitions are skipped meanwhile, so X does not jump. Movement
The pack's two jets burn meanwhile: the game's own jet mobys, driven from here, and Ratchet's Thruster-Pack sound plays when it starts.


Usage

    .venv/bin/python build.py              build build/EBOOT.elf from the untouched RC1.ppu.elf
    .venv/bin/python build.py --install    ... and copy it over RPCS3's EBOOT.BIN (the file there
                                           is kept once as EBOOT.BIN.bak); restart RPCS3 afterwards

# for as long as the dash stands in for his own state code; every dash ended in the wall bump

# land him themselves: going down within this height of a ground the probe found (its distance
# +0x2dc is 32 without one), he is put on the ground and into his idle state.
# Second trace the same day (102 dashes): 85 landed so, 17 did not: on the frame of the landing,

# level, on the dash's own gravity). So a landing is a phase of the dash now: for up to this many

# keeps him from making it: from the top of the arc (vertical speed below 0) the pitch goes back

# hero_main, moves +0x224 towards +0x22c. It sets +0x22c per character (Clank 0.45), but in
# state type 4, a jump, past the launch delay, it takes hero +0x434 instead, a jump parameter
# that Ratchet's set_state fills and that is 0 for a Clank who has not jumped. The dash sets
# state type 4 for the camera, so his sphere sank to his feet and rested on the floor with him
# 0.30 up. The same function leaves +0x224 alone while the sphere touches something under him,
# which is why he stayed there through his own states until a jump. The dash now writes his own
# height to +0x434 and +0x224 on every frame.

# of 33 still stuck, level, so none of the three readings above (pitch on the landing frame, a

# Boots on Ratchet's feet. RC1's equipment-slot manager (0x85b30) handles four slots; slot 1 is

# +0x20f0 + 4*slot (0x26 = nothing) and restores it when +0x210c + 4*slot is set. The game
# requests the Grindboots (item 0x1d, two mobys of class 0xc3) this way while grinding.
#
# RC2's Charge Boots are item 0x36 -> two mobys of class 0xe70 (gadget tables: RC1 0x721000,
# 0x4c per item; RC2 0xd0 per item). That model and its 256x256 texture are embedded and
# installed once per boot:
#   * 0x20000 bytes are taken from the top of the main heap (0x90d7c8) and of the graphics heap
#     (0x90d7ec) by lowering their end pointers; model data has to be in memory the graphics
#     side can read (from the I/O base at [[0x8fa564] + 0x4a8]), which the ELF's own segments
#     are not
#   * the model is copied there and prepared by the game's own model fix-up 0xdbc38
#   * its two texture groups are pointed at an own texture entry (same 0x24-byte layout in
#     both games) whose pixels are in the graphics heap
# The model shares the model slot of class 0xc3 (CLASS_SLOT_MAP -> MODEL_TABLE): a moby takes its
# model pointer from that table when it is created (SPAWN), so the Charge Boots model is put
# there for the length of one SPAWN call and the level's own model is put back afterwards. Every
# frame the level's model is looked up again (a level load brings a new one), and the
# environment-mapped group is pointed at that level's texture table.
#
# The item table has no free row (ids 0..0x24 are all in use and other data follows it), so on
# Ratchet's feet the Charge Boots are the Grindboots item 0x1d with the other model: the two foot
# slot SPAWN calls (FOOT_SPAWN_HOOKS) pick the model by the foot mode in STATE and by whether he
# is grinding (state type 0xf, when the game itself asks for the Grindboots). When the boots on
# his feet have the wrong model for the moment, they are taken off, and the game or the port
# puts the right ones on.
#
# Pause menu, Gadgets page (widgets from 0x729ec0): four grids of 10-byte entries {+0 icon,
# +2 icon variant, +4 kind, +6 item id}; a grid is {+0x3c cursor, +0x40 rows, +0x44 columns,
# +0x48 entries}. MENU +4 is the page (+0x40 its focused widget), +0x30 the item worn per slot:
# copied from the slots when the menu opens, and whatever differs when it closes is requested
# from the slot manager. The confirm button puts the entry's item into its slot's word, or 0 if
# it is there already (foot and head items). The grid draws an entry only when its item is
# unlocked, and framed when it is the one in its slot's word.
# The Foot Items grid (FOOT_GRID, 1 x 2: Grindboots, Magneboots) is pointed at an embedded
# table with a third entry and made 1 x 3. That entry is recognised by its address:
#   * drawn always, framed while the foot mode is 0 (GRID_ENTRY_HOOK)
#   * the confirm button toggles the foot mode and sets the slot's word (GRID_PRESS_HOOK)
#   * the name widget (item table as its text array) gets an embedded string (TEXT_HOOK)
#   * the model preview shows the Charge Boots: CHARGE_CLASS is a second class id for the
#     boots' model slot, so the preview sees another class than the Grindboots' and makes a new
#     moby (PREVIEW_CLASS_HOOK, PREVIEW_SPAWN_HOOK)
# and the Grindboots entry is not framed while the Charge Boots are on (both are item 0x1d).
#
# Icons: ICON_SPRITE(icon id, version) looks the id up in the list at HUD +0x1c ({id, versions,
# first sprite, -} per icon) and returns a sprite number; ICON_DRAW(sprite, x, y, w, h, alpha)
# takes the sprite's texture index from the words at HUD +0x20 and draws the entry at
# level texture table + 0x24 * index. Item icons are 64x64 DXT5 textures without mips, version 0
# a black shape (not in use), version 1 a white one (worn). The Charge Boots' two textures
# (tools/icon.py) go into the graphics heap behind the boots' texture. For the length of one
# ICON_DRAW call the Grindboots sprite's texture index is replaced by one that leads to an own
# entry: the index may be negative, and the entry is copied to the first address in ICON_SLOTS
# that is a whole number of entries away from the level's table.
#
# Size of a box on the menu pages: each of a page's 14 frames is a moby of class 0x472 playing
# one animation of that model (the page's animation ids are its first 14 words; the Foot Items
# box is 0x26, the Head Items box 0x25). The frame's update 0x1dbdb0 takes width and height from
# the positions of joints 1 to 3 against joint 0. In the animation's last frame, the pose that
# stays, the translations are 16-bit words: +0x38 the root's x, y, z and from +0x40 one
# {x, y, z, joint << 8} per corner. The Foot Items box has its root at y 5303 with the corners
# at +-2394, the wider boxes above it at 4306 with +-3425; foot_box writes those values into the
